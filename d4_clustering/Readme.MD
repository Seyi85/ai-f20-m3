The homework for today is split into two parts:
- Partitional Clustering 
- Hierarchical Clustering

# 01 Partitional Clustering  (K-Means)
Read the associated [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vOKyDRe6mIBTFhdq8d_PfQSfqz_H5dWL/view) and review the [class slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h4PLEhmDoN6WmCGzra40zyIYP9O5FqWTICJMvy_YAl4/edit). Additionally, you have a functional demo of kmeans working [here](https://github.com/jcllobet/akademy_batch_2/blob/master/4th_week/1_monday/exercises/02.%20Partitional%20Algorithms/plot_kmeans_digits.ipynb) as well as a [guided notebook.](https://github.com/jcllobet/akademy_batch_2/blob/master/4th_week/1_monday/exercises/02.%20Partitional%20Algorithms/KMeans_Guided_Notebook.ipynb). Inside **exercises> 01 Partitional Clustering**  
- *exercise_01_looking_for_clusters_visually.ipynb
- *exercise_02_clustering_2D_points.ipynb
- *exercise_03_inspect_your_clustering.ipynb
- *exercise_04_how_many_clusters_of_grain.ipynb
- *exercise_05_evaluating_the_grain_clustering.ipynb
- *exercise_06_scaling_the_fish_data.ipynb
- *exercise_07_clustering_the_fish.ipynb
- *exercise_08_clustering_stocks_using_kmeans.ipynb
- *exercise_09_which_stocks_move_together.ipynb

# 02 - Hierarchical Clustering
It is a series of short notebooks to test your understanding via jupyter notebooks. Inside **exercises> 02 - Hierarchical Clustering** 
- *exercise_10_hierarchical_clustering_grain.ipynb
- *exercise_11_hierachies_of_stocks.ipynb
- *exercise_12_which_clusters_are_closest.ipynb
- *exercise_13_different_linkage_different_hc.ipynb
- *exercise_14_intermediate_clusterings.ipynb
- *exercise_15_extracting_cluster_labels.ipynb

# 03 - BONUS Challenge
Implement K-Means from scratch based on this [tutorial with 2D arrays](https://pythonprogramming.net/k-means-from-scratch-machine-learning-tutorial/). 

## How to run the notebooks

- Launch an executable version of a notebook in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Google account needed) by opening it and clicking this button: ![Open In Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)

- Download this exercises and run a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook server on your local machine, then **push them to github**.
